This is a fork of Alex Li's cas_authentication plugin. (http://code.google.com/p/rc-cas-plugin)

The main difference is that this plugin allows users to either authn using
the normal login form or a CAS (Central Authentication System - http://www.jasig.org/cas)
server. It also should work in Roundcube 0.7 without having to modify Roundcube code.

This plugin has been tested and works with the following:
 - RHEL (specifically, Oracle Enterprise Linux) 6.1 x64
 - JASIG CAS 3.3.2 (http://www.jasig.org/cas)
 - pam_cas (https://sourcesup.cru.fr/frs/?group_id=213, Pam_cas-2.0.11-esup-2.0.5.tar.gz)
 - up-imapproxy 1.2.7 (http://www.imapproxy.org)
 - Dovecot 2.0.13 (http://dovecot.org)

Setup is very similar to most Roundcube plugins. Copy cas_authn_opt to your Roundcube
plugin directory. Then, copy config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php, edit for your environment, 
and activate the plugin. Some things to be aware of:

1) This plugin assumes your IMAP server can authenticate (a) CAS proxy tickets (if opt_cas_proxy
   is true) or (b) any user using the "master" password (if opt_cas_proxy is false and 
   opt_cas_imap_password is set). For (a), the most common way to do this is with pam_cas. See
   http://www.esup-portail.org/consortium/espace/SSO_1B/tech/cas/cas_pam.html for help
   configuring and testing that. (It is in French, but Google Translate does a good job.)

2) This plugin assumes you are not using SMTP authentication.

TODO/Known Issues:
1) SMTP Authentication probably does not work, even to an SMTP server that is using pam_cas.
   It might work if PAM itself caches passwords and the SMTP authn attempt uses the same
   cache as IMAP. I'm working on fixing this, probably by adding CAS proxy tickets to 
   SMTP authn in Roundcube.
